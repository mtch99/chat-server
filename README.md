# chat-server
A real-time chat server, with a graphql api

## Description

### Project brief
A server capable of storing a conversation and sending real-time updates to connected users, using a graphql api.

### Purpose
My dear friend [Brian Moyou](https://github.com/smbrmoyo) and I are on a journey of expanding our knowledge in server-side programming. 
Lately, we have been curious about the behind-the-scenes operations of a real-time server. We then started a challenge of developing such a server separately.
For the sake of skill-building, we constrained ourselves to implement graphql subscriptions real-time communication with clients from scratch.
